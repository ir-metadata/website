# Demonstration on Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/irgroup/ir_metadata/blob/master/resources/demo.ipynb)

In order to demonstrate what kinds of reproducibility experiments and meta-evaluation are made possible through the metadata annotations, we provide an [interactive Python notebook that can be run on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/irgroup/ir_metadata/blob/master/resources/demo.ipynb).

The notebook gives a general introduction to the metadata handling that is implemented by the [`metadata`](https://github.com/irgroup/repro_eval/blob/8799a61611b39dd798df2767370c1dca4ce9792f/repro_eval/metadata.py)-module in [`repro_eval`](https://github.com/irgroup/repro_eval) and provides the experiments of Section 6 in the resource paper.
