# Demonstration on Colab

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/irgroup/ir-metatdata/blob/master/demo.ipynb)

In order to demonstrate what kinds of reproducibility experiments and meta-evaluation are made possible through the metadata annotations, we provide an [interactive Python notebook that can be run on Google Colab]().

The notebook gives a general introduction to the metadata handling that is implemented by the metadata-module in `repro_eval` and provides the experiments of Section 6 in the SIGIR resource paper.
