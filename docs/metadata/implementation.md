# Implementation

The **Implementation** is closely related to the  [Method](../method). What is more formally described by the [Method](../method) is translated by the Implementation into operations that can be conducted *in silico*. The metadata information about the Implementation should include the URL of the open-source repository if available. If so, also the commit at which the code of the repository was used should be made explicit. If the experiments are run from the command line, the corresponding commands including all the arguments and parameters should be added.
